Cloud Spanner : Migratting a database to Cloud Spanner the current model uses auto increment values as Primary Key .
YOu need to keep those values but don't want to use them as Primary Key.?
How Could you create Primary Key that does not use an auto-increment value?
Ans:
   Use a Hash function value of the auto-increment value
   use binary reversed value of the value .

  *. Managed NOSQL database
  *. Uses the document models
      *. Key-value pairs
	  *. Hierarchical
  Two models
